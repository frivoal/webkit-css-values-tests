This repo contains copies of the tests from https://trac.webkit.org/browser/webkit/trunk/LayoutTests/css3/calc,
with a series of fixes to make them:
* correct according to the latest spec
* acceptable for submission to [WPT](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt)

This is meant as a working space for [TalbotG](https://github.com/TalbotG/) and [frivoal](https://github.com/frivoal)
so that we can work on the tests themselves,
before worying about the right way to submit them to Webkit and/or WPT.
