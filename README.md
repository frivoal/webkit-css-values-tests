This repo contains copies of the tests from https://trac.webkit.org/browser/webkit/trunk/LayoutTests/css3/calc as of revision 239665,
with a series of fixes to make them:
* correct according to the latest spec
* acceptable for submission to [WPT](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt)

This is meant as a working space for [TalbotG](https://github.com/TalbotG/) and [frivoal](https://github.com/frivoal)
so that we can work on the tests themselves,
before worying about the right way to submit them to Webkit and/or WPT.

The following test should not be ported to WPT, since they test features that are neither standard features nor documented in https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/:
* simple-calcs-prefixed.html
* zoom-with-em.html
* box-reflect.html
* webkit-gradient-calc.html
* reflection-computed-style.html


The following tests may be ported to WPT, as they test standard features, as they are crash tests rather than conformance tests, it is not certain whether that's useful:
* transition-crash.html
* transition-crash2.html
* transition-crash3.html
* transition-crash4.html
* lexer-regression-57581.html
* lexer-regression-57581-2.html
* lexer-regression-57581-3.html
* regression-62276.html
* cubic-bezier-with-multiple-calcs-crash.html.html

Everything else should be added to WPT.

----

Todo: finish reviewing and converting the following tests:
* those listed above as (maybe) not to be ported to WPT
* getComputedStyle-margin-percentage.html
* simple-calcs.html
* simplification.html
* transitions-dependent.html
* transitions.html
